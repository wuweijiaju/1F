Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### cheatsheet\r\n‘Markdown image syntax looks a lot like the syntax for links; it is essentially the same syntax preceded by an exclamation point (!). For example, if you want to link to an image at https://github.com/unicorn.png with the alternate text My Unicorn, you would write ![My Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn.png).’\r\n\r\n### 1\r\nTo create inline spans of code, simply wrap the code in backticks (`).

Double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__) are treated as bold using the <strong> tag. To create italic or bold text, simply wrap your words in single/double asterisks/underscores. For example, **My double emphasis text** becomes My double emphasis text, and *My single emphasis text* becomes My single emphasis text.’\r\n\r\n### links(./links)\r\n[links](./links)\r\n [[my internal link|internal-links]]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
